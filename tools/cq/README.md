# cq - Command-line CBOR processor

Similar to `jq`, the `cq` tool is designed to pretty print the COSE signature in a human-readable manner.

## Build

Under the root folder of this repository, execute

```sh
make build-tools
```

to build the tools, and the `cq` binary will be built at `bin/tools/cq`.
